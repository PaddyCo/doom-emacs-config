#+TITLE: PaddyCo's Doom Emacs Config

* General
Some functionality uses this to identify you, e.g. GPG configuration, email
clients, file templates and snippets.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq user-full-name "PaddyCo"
      user-mail-address "patrik@not-a-real-email.com")
#+end_src

* Appearance
** Fonts
Doom exposes five (optional) variables for controlling fonts in Doom. Here
are the three important ones:

+ ~doom-font~
+ ~doom-variable-pitch-font~
+ ~doom-big-font~ -- used for ~doom-big-font-mode~; use this for
  presentations or streaming.

They all accept either a font-spec, font string ("Input Mono-12"), or xlfd
font string. You generally only need these two:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq doom-font (font-spec :family "Fira Code" :size 16))
#+end_src

doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "sans-serif" :size 18))

** Theme
You can use ~load-theme~ (SPC h t) to explore and load new themes, set theme name below to save it:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq doom-theme 'doom-horizon)
#+end_src

** Other
This determines the style of line numbers in effect. If set to `nil', line
numbers are disabled. For relative line numbers, set this to `relative'.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq display-line-numbers-type t)
#+end_src

Automatically full-screen Emacs on start-up
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(fullscreen . maximized))
#+end_src

* Writing
Will automatically enable ~mixed-pitch-mode~ in specified modes
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar mixed-pitch-modes '(org-mode LaTeX-mode markdown-mode gfm-mode Info-mode)
  "Modes that `mixed-pitch-mode' should be enabled in, but only after UI initialisation.")
(defun init-mixed-pitch-h ()
  "Hook `mixed-pitch-mode' into each mode in `mixed-pitch-modes'.
Also immediately enables `mixed-pitch-modes' if currently in one of the modes."
  (when (memq major-mode mixed-pitch-modes)
    (mixed-pitch-mode 1))
  (dolist (hook mixed-pitch-modes)
    (add-hook (intern (concat (symbol-name hook) "-hook")) #'mixed-pitch-mode)))
(add-hook 'doom-init-ui-hook #'init-mixed-pitch-h)
#+end_src

Set heading size in Markdown

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces
 '(markdown-header-face-1 ((t (:inherit outline-1 :height 1.5))))
 '(markdown-header-face-2 ((t (:inherit outline-2 :height 1.35))))
 '(markdown-header-face-3 ((t (:inherit outline-3 :height 1.20))))
 '(markdown-header-face-4 ((t (:inherit outline-4 :height 1.1)))))
#+end_src

* Org mode
In this section I keep all Org mode specific configuration

** Files
Set Org directory
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-directory "/mnt/dropbox/Org/")
#+end_src

Set Org agenda files
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-files '("/mnt/dropbox/Org"))
#+end_src

Set deft files
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq deft-directory "/mnt/dropbox/Org/Notes")
#+end_src

** Images
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! org-download)
(add-hook 'dired-mode-hook 'org-download-enable)
#+end_src

** Appearance
Hide emphasis markers for bold/italic etc (e.g. *, /, _, =, ~ etc)
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-hide-emphasis-markers t)
#+end_src

Better looking bullets for Org
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! org-bullets
    :config (add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda () (org-bullets-mode 1))))
#+end_src

Bulleted lists
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(font-lock-add-keywords 'org-mode
                         '(("^ *\\([-+]\\) "
                            (0 (prog1 () (compose-region (match-beginning 1) (match-end 1) "â€¢"))))))
#+end_src

Header sizes
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces
  '(org-level-1 ((t (:inherit outline-1 :height 1.5))))
  '(org-level-2 ((t (:inherit outline-2 :height 1.35))))
  '(org-level-3 ((t (:inherit outline-3 :height 1.20))))
  '(org-level-4 ((t (:inherit outline-4 :height 1.1))))
)
#+end_src

** Utility
Diary function for last day of the month
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun last-day-of-month (date)
"Return `t` if DATE is the last day of the month."
  (let* ((day (calendar-extract-day date))
         (month (calendar-extract-month date))
         (year (calendar-extract-year date))
         (last-day-of-month
            (calendar-last-day-of-month month year)))
    (= day last-day-of-month)))
#+end_src
to use:
=SCHEDULED: <%%(last-day-of-month date)>=

Diary function for last weekday of the month
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun last-weekday-of-month (date)
  (let* ((day-of-week (calendar-day-of-week date))
         (month (calendar-extract-month date))
         (year (calendar-extract-year date))
         (last-month-day (calendar-last-day-of-month month year))
         (month-day (cadr date)))

    (or
     ;; it's the last day of the month & it is a weekday
     (and (eq month-day last-month-day)
          (memq day-of-week '(1 2 3 4 5)))

     ;; it's a friday, and it's the last-but-one or last-but-two day
     ;; of the month
     (and (eq day-of-week 5)
          (or (eq month-day (1- last-month-day))
              (eq month-day (1- (1- last-month-day))))))))
#+end_src
to use:
=SCHEDULED: <%%(last-weekday-of-month date)>=

** Export
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'org-latex-packages-alist
             '("AUTO" "babel" t ("pdflatex")))
#+end_src

** To-do

*** TODO Global default HTML export styling?

* Languages

** Assembly
Set =asm-mode= for =.inc= files
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.inc\\'" . asm-mode))
#+end_src

* Notes
Here are some additional functions/macros that could help you configure Doom:

- ~load!~ for loading external *.el files relative to this one
- ~use-package!~ for configuring packages
- ~after!~ for running code after a package has loaded
- ~add-load-path!~ for adding directories to the ~load-path~, relative to
  this file. Emacs searches the ~load-path~ when you load packages with
  ~require~ or ~use-package~.
- ~map!~ for binding new keys

To get information about any of these functions/macros, move the cursor over
the highlighted symbol at press 'K' (non-evil users must press 'C-c c k').
This will open documentation for it, including demos of how they are used.

You can also try ~gd~ (or 'C-c c d') to jump to their definition and see how
they are implemented.
